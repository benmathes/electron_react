# A scaffolding exercise with electron+react

Electron + React is starting to gain momentum as the best way to write native apps.
It's a clever set of Node.js plugins so you can use React.js and other web techs to make native apps.
Pretty sure it's how a lot of companies like Slack, etc. all have such slick native apps with so few people, because they can re-use nearly all their web code.

And react.js also runs native across ios and android, so you get a lot more code sharing.
Who knows if this equilibrium among the platforms will stick, but it's good right now.

Especialliay since things are fracturing away from the web as a common platform.
Lots of devs want to believe that the open web is still a thing. At least for where growth is, the web mostly isn't :-/.

Which makes me very, very sad. All the growth is on controlled, private platform.
May as well learn how to exist in this new world.
